# Network Modeller NG

This was a project to upgrade the first version of this application which was written in C++ / RAW Windows API. This version used MFC and had loads of additional features such as custom layers, internal services. 

It was something I stopped working on in 2016 but throughly enjoyed it, I love c++ :-)

Now here just for prosperity.
